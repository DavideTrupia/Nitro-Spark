# Confidential Computing Data Analytics with Apache Spark in AWS NitroEnclaves

## Leveraging AWS Nitro for secure distributed data processing
Security is one of the major concerns in the development of dependable distributed systems. In this project, we leverage AWS NitroEnclaves to deploy an Apache Spark cluster securely.

Tested on:

* Apache Spark version: Spark 3.2.0 (Oct 13 2021)
* AWS Nitro EC2 instance: **[TBD]**

## Getting started
